# Facebook Login Page
This project is a replica of the iconic Facebook login page. It's a static web page developed using HTML and CSS.

The objective of this project was to practice and improve my HTML and CSS skills by replicating one of the most widely recognized login pages on the web. I believe recreating real-world examples is an excellent way to learn and understand different aspects of web development.

The project was developed using HTML for the structure of the page and CSS for styling. Notable CSS features used in the project include Flexbox and CSS Selectors.
